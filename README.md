ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Putri
Software Developer | Business Optimizer | Fast Learner

I thrive at the intersection of business, technology, and optimization. My mission? To build tools that make business workflows smoother, and users happierâ€”while helping businesses grow.

What drives me:

ðŸ’¡ Solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code.

ðŸš€ Optimizing everything: From resource planning apps to incident management bots, I love cutting inefficiencies.

ðŸ¤– How systems talk: Fascinated by integrations, APIs, and making disparate tools work seamlessly (like ServiceNow scripting or linking databases).

ðŸ“Š Data-powered decisions: Trained in Python, SQL, and analyticsâ€”I turn insights into action.

ðŸŒ± Learning fast: From Php, Python, Rust to React, Iâ€™m always adding tools to my kit.

How I add value:

Built a desktop app for an omnibus operation in Berlin that streamlined resource planning, saving time and complexity.

Automated request and incident management with chatbots and scripts (ServiceNow) to accelerate IT workflows.

Slashed 90% of manual processes for a pharmacyâ€™s inventory system by developing real-time tracking tools.

Love documentation and testingâ€”because reliable systems start with clarity.

Letâ€™s connect if you:

Need a developer who understands business impact.

Want to optimize workflows or build user-friendly tools.

Are as excited about solving problems with creativity in tech as I am!
